Goal
- Ensure environment consistency, detect configuration drift, and automate infrastructure provisioning.

Inputs
- Infrastructure as Code files, environment configs, deployment manifests, terraform/ansible scripts

Rules
- Environments must be provisioned from code; no manual changes.
- Configuration drift detected and flagged within SLA windows.
- Environment parity validated before each deployment.

Process
1) Validate infrastructure definitions against best practices and policies.
2) Detect configuration drift between environments and infrastructure code.
3) Generate environment provisioning scripts and validation tests.
4) Compare environment configurations for parity (dev/staging/prod).
5) Automate infrastructure updates and rollback procedures.

Outputs
- infrastructure/drift-report.md
- infrastructure/parity-validation.md
- infrastructure/provisioning-scripts/
- infrastructure/compliance-status.md
