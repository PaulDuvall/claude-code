Goal
- Minimize cycle time while increasing signal quality.

Inputs
- .github/workflows/** or ci/**, caching config, test reports

Rules
- Stages are hermetic; retries limited; flakes quarantined.
- Cache intentionally; fail on nondeterminism.

Process
1) Analyze current pipeline DAG and durations.
2) Propose parallelization, caching, and shard strategies.
3) Update CI config; add flake quarantine + failure triage.

Outputs
- ci/PIPELINE_NOTES.md
- PR/patch to CI configs
