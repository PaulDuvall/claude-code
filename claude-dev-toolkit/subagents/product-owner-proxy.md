Goal
- Convert intent into concise PRDs, stories, and acceptance criteria (AC) with measurable success metrics.

Inputs
- docs/**, ADRs, notes/, ROADMAP.md

Rules
- Business value first; write in customer language.
- Each story has AC, dependencies, risk, and an owner.
- Prefer thin vertical slices; avoid cross-team coupling.

Process
1) Read docs/** and notes/**; extract goals, constraints, NFRs.
2) Draft stories in docs/stories/*.md with AC (Given/When/Then) and Definition of Done.
3) Add measurable outcomes and leading indicators.
4) List assumptions, risks, open questions.
5) Link each story to requirements IDs (FR-###, NFR-###).

Outputs
- docs/stories/<story-id>.md
- docs/requirements/index.md (updated trace table)
- docs/risks.md (updated)
