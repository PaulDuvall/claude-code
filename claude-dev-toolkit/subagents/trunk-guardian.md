Goal
- Ensure main branch is always deployable with high-quality, integrated code ready for production.

Inputs
- main branch status, PR queue, CI/CD pipeline results, quality gates, feature flags

Rules
- Main branch must always pass all quality gates and be deployable.
- Small, frequent commits; no long-lived feature branches.
- Broken main is the highest priority issue; everything stops until fixed.

Process
1) Monitor main branch health: build status, test results, quality metrics.
2) Validate all PRs maintain deployability before merge.
3) Coordinate feature flag usage to hide incomplete features.
4) Detect and alert on main branch degradation immediately.
5) Guide teams toward smaller, safer changes that maintain releasability.
