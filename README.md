# Claude Code Custom Commands

A comprehensive collection of custom slash commands for Claude Code that accelerate software development workflows through AI-powered automation.

## Overview

**This repository contains extensions FOR Claude Code, not Claude Code itself.** These custom commands extend the functionality of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI tool, providing intelligent automation for every stage of the software development lifecycle, from planning and architecture to deployment and monitoring. Each command leverages AI to analyze your codebase and provide contextual assistance.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into four main categories:
- **`slash-commands/active/`** - 15 essential commands for daily development workflows
- **`slash-commands/experiments/`** - 38+ specialized commands for advanced use cases
- **`hooks/`** - Security hooks for governance, compliance, and workflow automation
- **`specs/`** - Command specifications and validation framework
- **`docs/`** - Comprehensive documentation including the complete hooks system specification

## Prerequisites

**You must have Claude Code installed and configured before using these custom commands.**

### Install Claude Code

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authentication Setup

Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods:

#### Option 1: Web-Based Authentication (Recommended)
Most users can authenticate through their browser:
1. Run `claude` for the first time
2. Follow the browser authentication prompts
3. If you're already logged into claude.ai (especially as a Pro user), it will automatically connect

#### Option 2: Manual API Key Setup
For programmatic use, CI/CD environments, or specific enterprise setups:
```bash
# Set your API key as an environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'
```

**Most users will use web-based authentication and won't need to manually set an API key.**

For detailed installation and configuration options, see [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Quick Start

### 1. Validate Commands (Optional)

Validate command specifications and ensure quality standards:

```bash
./validate-commands.sh
```

This script creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and runs the command validation test suite to ensure all commands meet specifications.

### 2. Deploy Custom Commands

Deploy the 15 essential commands to your Claude Code installation:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This copies essential command files from `slash-commands/active/` to `~/.claude/commands/`, making them available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### 3. Optional: Configure Claude Code (Convenience Script)

This repository includes a convenience script for Claude Code configuration:

```bash
# Configure Claude Code for macOS/Windsurf (with security warnings)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes first
./configure-claude-code.sh             # Apply configuration
```

The `configure-claude-code.sh` script automates Claude Code setup with:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security warnings** and backup mechanisms
- API key configuration and validation
- Windsurf IDE extension installation
- MCP server setup (Docker required)
- Trust settings and permissions
- Interactive mode with dry-run option

### 4. Enable Security Hooks (Optional)

For automated governance and security monitoring, enable the hooks system:

```bash
# Copy security hook to Claude Code hooks directory
cp hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh

# Configure in ~/.claude/settings.json (see hooks/README.md for details)
```

**When Hooks Execute:**
- **Tool calls**: Triggered when Claude Code invokes tools like Bash, Edit, or Write
- **Code generation**: Activated when AI generates code that might contain sensitive information
- **File operations**: Executed before writing files or making changes to the codebase
- **Command execution**: Run when slash commands are invoked

The hooks system provides:
- üîí **Real-time Security**: Prevents credential exposure in AI-generated code
- üìä **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all AI actions and decisions
- üõ°Ô∏è **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance and governance
- üîÑ **Workflow Integration**: Seamless CI/CD and development tool integration

### Using Experimental Commands

**Note: Experimental commands are conceptual specifications, not fully implemented tools.**

The 38+ commands in `slash-commands/experiments/` are well-structured design documents that represent sophisticated frameworks for advanced development workflows. These are conceptual specifications that would require implementation to become functional commands.

To explore experimental commands:
- Review the `.md` files in `slash-commands/experiments/` to understand their potential capabilities
- Use them as blueprints for developing actual implementations
- Temporarily modify `deploy.sh` to use `slash-commands/experiments/` if you want to experiment with the conceptual frameworks

# Show help
./configure-claude-code.sh --help
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Always review the configuration script before running it. It modifies system configurations and handles API keys.

### Development Workflow
1. **Create new commands** in the `slash-commands/active/` directory as `.md` files (for essential commands) or `slash-commands/experiments/` (for specialized commands)
2. **Validate commands** by running `./validate-commands.sh` to ensure compliance with specifications
3. **Test locally** by running `./deploy.sh` and using the command in Claude Code
4. **Follow the established patterns** for command structure and documentation
5. **Commit and share** improvements with the team

### Command Structure & Validation

Each command follows this pattern:
- YAML frontmatter with description and tags
- Usage examples and parameter documentation
- Implementation logic with bash commands and AI prompts
- Integration points with other commands
