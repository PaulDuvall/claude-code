# Claude Code Custom Commands

A comprehensive collection of custom slash commands for Claude Code that accelerate software development workflows through AI-powered automation.

## Overview

**What is this?** This repository provides **custom slash commands** that extend Anthropic's Claude Code CLI tool with powerful development automation.

**Think of it like browser extensions:** Just as Chrome extensions add new features to your browser, these commands add new capabilities to Claude Code.

**You need both:**
1. **Claude Code** (the base CLI tool from Anthropic) - install with `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
2. **These custom commands** (this repository) - adds `/xtest`, `/xquality`, `/xsecurity`, etc.

These custom commands provide intelligent automation for every stage of software development, from testing and quality checks to security scanning and deployment. Each command leverages AI to analyze your codebase and provide contextual assistance.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into six main categories:
- **`slash-commands/active/`** - 13 essential commands for daily development workflows
- **`slash-commands/experiments/`** - 40+ specialized commands for advanced use cases
- **`templates/`** - Settings.json configuration templates for different use cases
- **`hooks/`** - Security hooks for governance, compliance, and workflow automation
- **`specs/`** - Command specifications and validation framework
- **`docs/`** - Comprehensive documentation including the complete hooks system specification

**Key Scripts:**
- **`setup.sh`** - Single-command complete setup (recommended)
- **`verify-setup.sh`** - Comprehensive diagnostic and validation tool
- **`validate-commands.sh`** - Enhanced validation framework with integration testing
- **`deploy.sh`** - Deploy custom commands with flexible options (active, experimental, or selective)
- **`configure-claude-code.sh`** - Configure Claude Code itself

## Prerequisites

**You must have Claude Code installed and configured before using these custom commands.**

### Install Claude Code

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

### Authentication Setup

Claude Code supports multiple authentication methods:

#### Option 1: Web-Based Authentication (Recommended)
Most users can authenticate through their browser:
1. Run `claude` for the first time
2. Follow the browser authentication prompts
3. If you're already logged into claude.ai (especially as a Pro user), it will automatically connect

#### Option 2: Manual API Key Setup
For programmatic use, CI/CD environments, or specific organizational setups:
```bash
# Set your API key as an environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'
```

**Most users will use web-based authentication and won't need to manually set an API key.**

For detailed installation and configuration options, see [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Quick Start

### üöÄ 5-Minute Setup (Recommended)

**Get started in under 5 minutes:**

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code (if not already installed)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Clone this repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-code

# 3. Run automated setup
./setup.sh

# 4. Start using commands
claude
/xtest
```

**That's it!** Your first custom command should work immediately.

### Complete Setup Options

**Single command setup** - handles everything automatically:

```bash
# Preview what will be done (recommended first run)
./setup.sh --dry-run

# Basic setup - custom commands only
./setup.sh

# Security setup - adds security hooks  
./setup.sh --setup-type security

# Comprehensive setup - full governance
./setup.sh --setup-type comprehensive
```

**What gets installed:**
1. ‚úÖ Claude Code configuration and authentication
2. ‚úÖ 13 custom commands (`/xtest`, `/xquality`, `/xsecurity`, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ Security hooks (if requested)
4. ‚úÖ Appropriate settings template
5. ‚úÖ Complete validation

**Authentication is automatic** - Claude Code will open your browser for login. No API key needed for most users.

### Advanced: Manual Step-by-Step Setup

For users who want granular control:

#### Step 1: Validate Commands (Optional)
```bash
./validate-commands.sh
```

#### Step 2: Configure Claude Code
```bash
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes
./configure-claude-code.sh             # Apply configuration
```

#### Step 3: Deploy Custom Commands
```bash
./deploy.sh                    # Deploy active commands (default)
./deploy.sh --experiments      # Deploy experimental commands
./deploy.sh --all              # Deploy both active and experimental
```

#### Step 4: Enable Hooks (Optional)

For automated governance, file logging, and security monitoring, enable the hooks system:

**Demo File Logger Hook (Safe for Learning):**
```bash
# Copy file logger hook to Claude Code hooks directory
cp hooks/file-logger.sh ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/file-logger.sh

# Configure in ~/.claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Edit|Write|MultiEdit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.claude/hooks/file-logger.sh",
            "blocking": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Security Hook (Production Use):**
```bash
# Copy security hook to Claude Code hooks directory
cp hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh

# Configure in ~/.claude/settings.json (see hooks/README.md for details)
```

**When Hooks Execute:**
- **Tool calls**: Triggered when Claude Code invokes tools like Bash, Edit, or Write
- **Code generation**: Activated when AI generates code that might contain sensitive information
- **File operations**: Executed before writing files or making changes to the codebase
- **Command execution**: Run when slash commands are invoked

The hooks system provides:
- üîí **Real-time Security**: Prevents credential exposure in AI-generated code
- üìä **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all AI actions and decisions
- üõ°Ô∏è **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance and governance
- üîÑ **Workflow Integration**: Seamless CI/CD and development tool integration

### Using Experimental Commands

**Note: Experimental commands are conceptual specifications, not fully implemented tools.**

The 42 commands in `slash-commands/experiments/` are well-structured design documents that represent sophisticated frameworks for advanced development workflows. These are conceptual specifications that would require implementation to become functional commands.

#### Deploying Experimental Commands

```bash
# Deploy all experimental commands
./deploy.sh --experiments

# Deploy specific experimental commands only
./deploy.sh --experiments --include xplanning --include xmetrics

# Deploy both active and experimental commands
./deploy.sh --all

# Preview what would be deployed
./deploy.sh --experiments --dry-run

# List all available commands
./deploy.sh --list
```

#### Advanced Deployment Options

```bash
# Selective deployment - deploy only specific commands
./deploy.sh --include xtest --include xquality --include xsecurity

# Exclude specific commands from deployment
./deploy.sh --all --exclude xdebug --exclude xconfig

# Deploy from custom directory
./deploy.sh --source /path/to/custom/commands

# Preview deployment without making changes
./deploy.sh --all --dry-run
```

## Getting Help with Commands

All custom commands include built-in help functionality for quick reference:

### Help Usage Patterns

```bash
# Get help for any command using 'help' or '--help'
/xsecurity help          # Shows comprehensive usage guide
/xtest --help            # Alternative help syntax
/xquality help           # Displays all available options

# Help works with all commands
/xarchitecture help      # Architecture design patterns
/xtdd help              # Test-driven development guide  
/xgit help              # Git workflow automation
/xrefactor help         # Code refactoring options
```

### Example Help Output

```bash
$ /xsecurity help

# Security Analysis
Perform comprehensive security scanning with intelligent defaults

## Usage Examples
**Basic usage (runs all security checks):**
/xsecurity

**Quick secret scan:**
/xsecurity secrets

**Dependency vulnerability check:**
/xsecurity deps

## Scan Types
- **Comprehensive** (default): Secrets + dependencies + code patterns + config review
- **Secrets**: Scan for exposed credentials, API keys, tokens
- **Dependencies**: Check for vulnerable packages and outdated versions

## What it finds
üî¥ **Critical**: Hardcoded secrets, high-severity vulnerabilities
üü° **Important**: Code anti-patterns, medium-severity issues
‚úÖ **Secure**: Areas that pass security checks
üõ°Ô∏è **Recommendations**: Preventive security improvements
```

### Help for All Command Categories

- **Quality Commands**: `/xquality help`, `/xrefactor help`, `/xtest help`
- **Security Commands**: `/xsecurity help` 
- **Development Commands**: `/xtdd help`, `/xdebug help`
- **Architecture Commands**: `/xarchitecture help`, `/xspec help`
- **DevOps Commands**: `/xgit help`, `/xpipeline help`, `/xrelease help`
- **Configuration Commands**: `/xconfig help`, `/xdocs help`

**Design Principle**: Every command is self-documenting with comprehensive help that includes usage patterns, examples, and parameter explanations.

### Additional Commands

43 experimental and specialized commands are available in `slash-commands/experiments/` for advanced use cases including planning, analytics, compliance, infrastructure, monitoring, CI/CD, and more.

**Deploy experimental commands using:**
```bash
./deploy.sh --experiments              # Deploy all experimental commands
./deploy.sh --experiments --include xplanning  # Deploy specific ones
./deploy.sh --list                     # See all available commands
```

**Important:** These experimental commands are conceptual specifications rather than working implementations. They represent sophisticated frameworks that would be valuable if implemented, but currently serve as design documents and blueprints for future development.

## Simple Usage Patterns

The active commands are designed with **smart defaults** and **simple usage patterns**:

### Basic Usage (No Parameters Needed)
```bash
/xquality    # Runs all quality checks (formatting, linting, type checking)
/xtest       # Runs all available tests
/xsecurity   # Runs comprehensive security scan
```

### Quick Actions (Single Word Arguments)
```bash
/xquality fix      # Auto-fix common quality issues
/xtest coverage    # Run tests with coverage analysis
/xtest unit        # Run unit tests only
/xsecurity secrets # Quick secret scan
/xsecurity deps    # Dependency vulnerability check
```

### Detailed Analysis (When You Need More Info)
```bash
/xquality report   # Detailed quality metrics and recommendations
```

**Design Philosophy:** Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible. Most commands work perfectly with no parameters, while advanced options remain available when needed.

## Command Scope: Project vs Machine-Wide

Understanding where to place commands and settings is crucial for effective Claude Code usage:

### Machine-Wide Commands (`~/.claude/commands/`)
- **Available in ALL projects** on your machine
- **Best for**: General development commands (`/xtest`, `/xquality`, `/xsecurity`)
- **Deploy with**: `./deploy.sh` (copies to global directory)
- **Use when**: Commands apply to any codebase
- **Examples**: Code quality, testing, security scanning

### Project-Specific Commands (`.claude/commands/`)  
- **Only available in current project**
- **Best for**: Project-specific workflows, team standards, domain logic
- **Create manually**: Place `.md` files directly in project's `.claude/commands/` directory
- **Use when**: Commands are specific to this project/team
- **Examples**: Project build scripts, domain-specific validations

### Settings Hierarchy
Claude Code checks settings in this order (first found wins):
1. **`.claude/settings.local.json`** - Project-specific, gitignored for secrets
2. **`.claude/settings.json`** - Project-specific, version controlled for team  
3. **`~/.claude/settings.json`** - Machine-wide defaults

### Hooks Scope
- **`~/.claude/hooks/`** - Apply to ALL projects (security, compliance)
- **`.claude/hooks/`** - Project-specific hooks (team workflows)

## Typical Builder Workflow

## Installation & Development

### Complete Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd claude-code

# Install Claude Code (if not already installed)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Run automated setup (authentication handled automatically)
./setup.sh --dry-run    # Preview what will be done
./setup.sh              # Apply basic setup

# Or for security-focused setup
./setup.sh --setup-type security
```

**Note:** Authentication is handled automatically via browser login. Manual API key setup is only needed for CI/CD or organizational environments.

### Manual Setup (Advanced Users)

```bash
# Validate commands (optional but recommended)
./validate-commands.sh

# Configure Claude Code (review script first!)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes
./configure-claude-code.sh             # Apply configuration

# Deploy custom commands (see deployment options below)
./deploy.sh                    # Active commands only (default)
./deploy.sh --experiments      # Experimental commands only  
./deploy.sh --all              # Both active and experimental

# Apply settings template manually (optional)
cp templates/basic-settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json
```

**Authentication:** Claude Code handles authentication automatically via browser login. Manual API key setup is only needed for CI/CD pipelines or organizational environments.

### Configuration Script Options

The `configure-claude-code.sh` script supports several modes:

```bash
# Safe preview mode (recommended first run)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run

# Interactive mode with backups (default)
./configure-claude-code.sh

# Non-interactive with backups
./configure-claude-code.sh --non-interactive

# Force mode (skip all prompts - use with caution)
./configure-claude-code.sh --force

# Show help
./configure-claude-code.sh --help
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Always review the configuration script before running it. It modifies system configurations and handles API keys.

### Development Workflow
1. **Create new commands** in the `slash-commands/active/` directory as `.md` files (for essential commands) or `slash-commands/experiments/` (for specialized commands)
2. **Validate commands** by running `./validate-commands.sh` to ensure compliance with specifications
3. **Test locally** by deploying specific commands: `./deploy.sh --include yourcommand` and using the command in Claude Code
4. **Follow the established patterns** for command structure and documentation
5. **Commit and share** improvements with the team

### Command Deployment Options
- `./deploy.sh` - Deploy active commands only (default)
- `./deploy.sh --experiments` - Deploy experimental commands only
- `./deploy.sh --all` - Deploy both active and experimental commands
- `./deploy.sh --include cmd1 cmd2` - Deploy specific commands only
- `./deploy.sh --exclude cmd1 cmd2` - Deploy all except specific commands
- `./deploy.sh --dry-run --all` - Preview what would be deployed
- `./deploy.sh --list` - List all available commands

### Command Structure & Validation

Each command follows this pattern:
- YAML frontmatter with description and tags
- Usage examples and parameter documentation
- Implementation logic with bash commands and AI prompts
- Integration points with other commands
- Output formatting and reporting

Commands must comply with specifications defined in `specs/`:
- **`specs/command-specifications.md`** - Executable specifications with test traceability
- **`specs/custom-command-specifications.md`** - Comprehensive development guidelines
- **`specs/tests/test_command_validation.py`** - Automated validation test suite

Run `./validate-commands.sh` to ensure all commands meet quality and security standards.

## Security Hooks System

This repository includes a **Claude Code Hooks System** that adds automated governance, security monitoring, and integration capabilities to AI-assisted development workflows.

### Current Implementation

The `/hooks/` directory contains production-ready security hooks:

- **`prevent-credential-exposure.sh`**: Security hook that prevents accidental credential exposure in AI-generated code
  - Detects 15+ credential patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys)
  - Blocks dangerous operations with detailed warnings and audit trails
  - Security team notifications via webhooks
