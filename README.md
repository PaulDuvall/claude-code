**Transform Claude Code into a complete development platform** with 57 AI-powered commands that automate your entire software development workflow.

## What This Does

This repository extends [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with **custom slash commands** that provide intelligent automation for:

- ‚ö° **Testing**: `/xtest` - Run tests, generate coverage reports, create test cases
- üîç **Code Quality**: `/xquality` - Format, lint, type-check with auto-fixes
- üîí **Security**: `/xsecurity` - Scan for vulnerabilities, secrets, security issues  
- üèóÔ∏è **Architecture**: `/xarchitecture` - Design systems, analyze patterns
- üöÄ **Git Workflow**: `/xgit` - Automated commits with smart messages
- üêõ **Debugging**: `/xdebug` - AI debugging assistant with persistent context
- üìö **Documentation**: `/xdocs` - Generate and maintain documentation
- üîß **Refactoring**: `/xrefactor` - Intelligent code improvements

**Think of it like VS Code extensions** - but for Claude Code. These commands give Claude deep knowledge of development workflows and tools.

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Get Started in 30 Seconds (NPM Installation)

```bash
# 1. Install Claude Code (if you haven't already)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# 2. Install Claude Dev Toolkit via NPM
npm install -g claude-dev-toolkit

# 3. Start using AI-powered development commands immediately
claude
