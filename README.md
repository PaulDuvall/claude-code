# Claude Code Custom Commands

A comprehensive collection of custom slash commands for Claude Code that accelerate software development workflows through AI-powered automation.

## Overview

**This repository contains extensions FOR Claude Code, not Claude Code itself.** These custom commands extend the functionality of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI tool, providing intelligent automation for every stage of the software development lifecycle, from planning and architecture to deployment and monitoring. Each command leverages AI to analyze your codebase and provide contextual assistance.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into three main categories:
- **`slash-commands/active/`** - 15 essential commands for daily development workflows
- **`slash-commands/experiments/`** - 38+ specialized commands for advanced use cases
- **`hooks/`** - Enterprise governance hooks for security, compliance, and workflow automation
- **`docs/`** - Comprehensive documentation including the complete hooks system specification

## Prerequisites

**You must have Claude Code installed and configured before using these custom commands.**

If you don't have Claude Code installed yet:

```bash
# Install Claude Code globally
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Set your API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'
```

For detailed Claude Code installation and configuration, see [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code).

## Quick Start

### 1. Deploy Custom Commands

Deploy the 15 essential commands to your Claude Code installation:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

This copies essential command files from `slash-commands/active/` to `~/.claude/commands/`, making them available as slash commands in Claude Code.

### 2. Optional: Configure Claude Code (Convenience Script)

This repository includes a convenience script for Claude Code configuration:

```bash
# Configure Claude Code for macOS/Windsurf (with security warnings)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes first
./configure-claude-code.sh             # Apply configuration
```

The `configure-claude-code.sh` script automates Claude Code setup with:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security warnings** and backup mechanisms
- API key configuration and validation
- Windsurf IDE extension installation
- MCP server setup (Docker required)
- Trust settings and permissions
- Interactive mode with dry-run option

### 3. Enable Enterprise Hooks (Optional)

For enterprise-grade governance and security, enable the hooks system:

```bash
# Copy security hook to Claude Code hooks directory
cp hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh ~/.claude/hooks/

# Make executable
chmod +x ~/.claude/hooks/prevent-credential-exposure.sh

# Configure in ~/.claude/settings.json (see hooks/README.md for details)
```

The hooks system provides:
- üîí **Real-time Security**: Prevents credential exposure in AI-generated code
- üìä **Audit Trails**: Complete logging of all AI actions and decisions
- üõ°Ô∏è **Policy Enforcement**: Automated compliance and governance
- üîÑ **Workflow Integration**: Seamless CI/CD and development tool integration

### Using Experimental Commands

**Note: Experimental commands are conceptual specifications, not fully implemented tools.**

The 38+ commands in `slash-commands/experiments/` are well-structured design documents that represent sophisticated frameworks for advanced development workflows. These are conceptual specifications that would require implementation to become functional commands.

To explore experimental commands:
- Review the `.md` files in `slash-commands/experiments/` to understand their potential capabilities
- Use them as blueprints for developing actual implementations
- Temporarily modify `deploy.sh` to use `slash-commands/experiments/` if you want to experiment with the conceptual frameworks

## Active Commands Reference

These 15 essential commands cover the core development workflow and are deployed by default:

### üéØ Planning & Strategy
- **`/xplanning`** - AI-assisted project planning with roadmaps, estimation, and risk analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design
- **`/xarchitecture`** - System architecture design and analysis with proven patterns

### üìã Requirements & Specifications
- **`/xspec`** - Requirements specification with ATDD/BDD integration

### Additional Commands

38+ experimental and specialized commands are available in `slash-commands/experiments/` for advanced use cases including analytics, compliance, infrastructure, monitoring, and more.

**Important:** These experimental commands are conceptual specifications rather than working implementations. They represent sophisticated frameworks that would be valuable if implemented, but currently serve as design documents and blueprints for future development.

## Installation & Development

### Complete Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository>
cd claude-code-commands

# Install and configure Claude Code
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'

# Configure Claude Code (review script first!)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes
./configure-claude-code.sh             # Apply configuration

# Deploy custom commands
./deploy.sh
```

### Configuration Script Options

The `configure-claude-code.sh` script supports several modes:

```bash
# Safe preview mode (recommended first run)
./configure-claude-code.sh --dry-run

# Interactive mode with backups (default)
./configure-claude-code.sh

# Non-interactive with backups
./configure-claude-code.sh --non-interactive

# Force mode (skip all prompts - use with caution)
./configure-claude-code.sh --force

# Show help
./configure-claude-code.sh --help
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note:** Always review the configuration script before running it. It modifies system configurations and handles API keys.

### Development Workflow
1. **Create new commands** in the `slash-commands/active/` directory as `.md` files (for essential commands) or `slash-commands/experiments/` (for specialized commands)
2. **Test locally** by running `./deploy.sh` and using the command in Claude Code
3. **Follow the established patterns** for command structure and documentation
4. **Commit and share** improvements with the team

### Command Structure
Each command follows this pattern:
- YAML frontmatter with description and tags
- Usage examples and parameter documentation
- Implementation logic with bash commands and AI prompts
- Integration points with other commands
- Output formatting and reporting

## Enterprise Hooks System

This repository includes a next-generation **Claude Code Hooks System** that transforms AI-assisted development into an enterprise-grade platform with comprehensive governance, security, and integration capabilities.

### Current Implementation

The `/hooks/` directory contains production-ready security hooks:

- **`prevent-credential-exposure.sh`**: Enterprise-grade security hook that prevents accidental credential exposure in AI-generated code
  - Detects 15+ credential patterns (API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys)
  - Blocks dangerous operations with detailed warnings and audit trails
  - Security team notifications via webhooks
  - Emergency override capability for authorized users
