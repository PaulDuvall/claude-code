# xreadiness - AI Development Readiness

Assess and improve AI development readiness across team, process, and technical dimensions.

## Usage

```bash
/xreadiness --assess             # Run comprehensive readiness assessment
/xreadiness --baseline           # Establish baseline metrics
/xreadiness --capabilities       # Assess AI development capabilities
/xreadiness --gaps               # Identify readiness gaps
/xreadiness --report             # Generate readiness report
```

## Examples

```bash
# Run full AI readiness assessment
/xreadiness --assess

# Establish baseline measurements
/xreadiness --baseline

# Evaluate current AI capabilities
/xreadiness --capabilities

# Identify improvement gaps
/xreadiness --gaps

# Generate executive readiness report
/xreadiness --report
```

## Expected Outputs

- **assess**: Readiness score (0-100) with specific improvement areas identified
- **baseline**: Baseline measurements for future comparison and progress tracking
- **capabilities**: Capability matrix showing strengths and development needs
- **gaps**: Prioritized list of gaps with remediation recommendations
- **report**: Executive summary with roadmap for AI readiness improvement

## Readiness Dimensions

### Technical Readiness
- SpecDriven AI implementation maturity
- Test automation and CI/CD pipeline quality
- Code quality and architectural compliance
- Security and compliance posture

### Process Readiness
- TDD adoption and discipline
- Specification management practices
- Development workflow optimization
- Quality assurance processes

### Team Readiness
- AI development skills and training
- Tool proficiency and adoption
- Collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Change management capability

## Readiness Levels

- **Level 1 (0-20)**: Basic - Ad-hoc development, minimal AI integration
- **Level 2 (21-40)**: Repeatable - Some AI practices, inconsistent application
- **Level 3 (41-60)**: Defined - Established AI processes, growing adoption
- **Level 4 (61-80)**: Managed - Mature AI practices, metrics-driven improvement
- **Level 5 (81-100)**: Optimizing - Advanced AI integration, continuous innovation

## Integration

- Works with `/xmaturity` for development maturity assessment
- Integrates with `/xspec` for SpecDriven AI methodology tracking
- Supports `/xobservable` for readiness metrics monitoring
- Links to `/xplanning` for readiness improvement roadmaps
