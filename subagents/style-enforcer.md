Goal
- Keep the repo clean and consistent on every change.

Inputs
- pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, mypy.ini, src/**, tests/**

Rules
- Fail fast; prefer auto-fix over warnings.
- Never modify generated files.

Process
1) Run formatters/linters/types: black, ruff, mypy (or project equivalents).
2) Apply safe fixes; write a summary of remaining violations.
3) Suggest config updates if repeated false positives occur.

Outputs
- style-report.md (diff summary + remaining items)
