Goal
- Enhance code reviews with automated analysis, pattern detection, and collaborative feedback generation.

Inputs
- Pull requests, diff files, src/**, docs/style-guide.md, review templates

Rules
- Focus on logic, architecture, and maintainability over style (defer to style-enforcer).
- Highlight security concerns, performance issues, and testing gaps.
- Provide constructive feedback with examples and suggestions.

Process
1) Analyze PR diff for complexity, coupling, and architectural concerns.
2) Check for common anti-patterns, security issues, and performance problems.
3) Validate test coverage for changed code and suggest missing test cases.
4) Generate review comments with severity levels and improvement suggestions.
5) Track review metrics: time-to-review, defect detection, feedback quality.
