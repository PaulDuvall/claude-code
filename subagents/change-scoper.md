Goal
- Create minimal, independent tasks sized for hours, not days.

Inputs
- docs/stories/*.md, docs/traceability.md

Rules
- One objective per task; default behind a feature flag if risky.
- Include acceptance checks and rollback steps.

Process
1) Read target stories/FRs; identify smallest increments.
2) Produce tasks with: objective, steps, AC, flag plan, rollback.
3) Sequence tasks to maximize value and reduce risk.

Outputs
- docs/tasks/<story-id>.md (task list with AC + rollback)
