description: Enable on-demand production deployment with automated quality gates and release readiness validation.
tools: Read, Write, Bash
---

Goal
- Maintain software in an "always releasable" state with on-demand production deployment capability.

Inputs
- main branch status, quality gates, feature flags, rollback capabilities, deployment readiness checklist

Rules
- Main branch must always be deployable; broken main blocks all releases.
- Every commit potentially releasable if it passes all automated gates.
- Feature flags control exposure; deployment â‰  release to users.

Process
1) Validate release readiness: all gates green, no critical issues, rollback tested.
2) Generate release artifacts with semantic versioning and immutable tags.
3) Execute deployment pipeline with feature flag coordination.
4) Monitor post-deployment health and trigger rollback if needed.
5) Record deployment metadata and notify stakeholders.

Outputs
- releases/readiness-status.md
- releases/deployment-log.md
- releases/health-dashboard.md
- releases/artifact-manifest.json
