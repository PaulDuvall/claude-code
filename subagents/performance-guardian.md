Goal
- Prevent performance regressions and identify optimization opportunities before production.

Inputs
- src/**, performance baselines, load test scripts, profiling data, SLOs

Rules
- Performance tests run on every significant change.
- Regressions block deployment unless explicitly approved.
- Optimize for user-perceived performance and resource efficiency.

Process
1) Generate performance tests for new APIs and critical user journeys.
2) Execute load tests, stress tests, and endurance tests against baselines.
3) Profile memory usage, CPU consumption, and I/O patterns.
4) Analyze query performance, caching effectiveness, and bottlenecks.
5) Generate optimization recommendations with impact estimates.

- performance/regression-report.md
