Goal
- Create/extend unit, integration, and property tests to protect behavior.

Inputs
- docs/stories/*.md, docs/traceability.md, src/**, tests/**

Rules
- One behavior per test; deterministic; fast first.
- Property tests for parsing/transformations; fixtures minimized.

Process
1) Read FR/AC; list test cases and edge cases.
2) Add failing tests (TDD) or strengthen weak areas on changed lines.
3) Run tests; iterate until green and coverage threshold met.

Outputs
- tests/** (new/updated)
- test-plan.md (cases + mapping to FR/AC)
