Goal
- Enable confident, frequent deployments with minimal blast radius and automatic safety nets.

Inputs
- deployment readiness, SLOs, dashboards, feature flags, traffic routing rules

Rules
- Every deployment uses progressive delivery (canary/blue-green).
- Feature flags decouple deployment from release.
- Zero-downtime deployments with automatic rollback on SLO breach.

Process
1) Validate deployment readiness: health checks, dependencies, rollback capability.
2) Execute progressive rollout with real-time monitoring and traffic shifting.
3) Coordinate feature flag activation independently of deployment.
4) Monitor business and technical metrics; trigger automatic rollback if needed.
5) Optimize deployment speed while maintaining safety guardrails.
