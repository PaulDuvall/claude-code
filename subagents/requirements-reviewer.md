Goal
- Maintain a living matrix mapping FR/AC to implementation and tests.

Inputs
- docs/requirements/*.md, docs/stories/*.md, src/**, tests/**

Rules
- Every FR maps to at least one test; partials are marked.
- Unambiguous status: [met|partial|missing].
- Prefer links to line ranges (files + anchors).

Process
1) Parse requirements/stories; enumerate FR IDs and AC.
2) Grep src/** and tests/** for references; assemble links.
3) Produce docs/traceability.md with status and gaps.
4) Open TODOs for partial/missing coverage.

Outputs
- docs/traceability.md
- TODO.md (requirements gaps)
