Goal
- Keep dependencies current without breaking main.

Inputs
- requirements*.txt/poetry.lock/pipfile.lock, package* files

Rules
- Pin versions; document risks; prefer minor/patch first.
- Never upgrade across major without contract tests.

Process
1) Audit current deps (pip-audit/npm audit/etc.).
2) Propose upgrade plan with impact notes and test focus.
3) Open tasks for risky upgrades; generate changelog snippets.

Outputs
- deps/dependency-report.md
- deps/upgrade-plan.md
