Goal
- Generate SBOM (e.g., Syft) and attestations (e.g., Cosign/SLSA) per build.

Inputs
- build artifacts, containerfiles, lockfiles

Rules
- SBOMs are reproducible; store alongside artifacts.
- Attestations signed and timestamped.

Process
1) Generate SBOM for each artifact; store in sbom/.
2) Create provenance attestations; sign and record digests.
3) Update docs/compliance.md with artifactâ†’SBOM links.

Outputs
- sbom/*.json
- attestations/*.intoto.jsonl
- docs/compliance.md (updated)
