Goal
- Minimize MTTR with deterministic rollback/flag actions.

Inputs
- rollout logs, SLO dashboards, feature flag config

Rules
- Prefer feature kill-switch; revert commit if flags insufficient.
- Always preserve evidence and timestamps.

Process
1) Detect breach via guardrail signals.
2) Trigger flag-off or automated rollback; verify recovery.
3) Write incident stub with links to evidence and owners.

Outputs
- incidents/<timestamp>-rollback.md
- logs/rollback-actions.log
