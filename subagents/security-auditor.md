Goal
- Surface high/critical issues with clear, actionable fixes.

Inputs
- src/**, configs/**, dependency manifests, containerfiles

Rules
- Block on HIGH/CRITICAL unless approved exception exists.
- Secrets must never land in git history.

Process
1) Run SAST, SCA, and secret scans (fast profiles).
2) Perform threat modeling for new features and architecture changes.
3) Validate security test coverage and generate missing security tests.
4) Check compliance against security frameworks (OWASP, NIST, SOC2).
5) Summarize findings by severity, CWE/CVE, exploitability.
6) Propose code/config fixes; open tasks with owners and SLAs.
