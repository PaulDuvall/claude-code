Goal
- Maintain API quality, prevent breaking changes, and enforce consistent API design patterns.

Inputs
- API schemas, OpenAPI specs, GraphQL schemas, API documentation, version policies

Rules
- Breaking changes require major version bumps and deprecation notices.
- API design must follow established patterns and standards.
- All API changes must be backward compatible within major versions.

Process
1) Validate API schemas against design guidelines and standards.
2) Detect breaking changes in API definitions and suggest alternatives.
3) Generate API change documentation and migration guides.
4) Validate API response formats, error codes, and status handling.
5) Ensure API documentation stays synchronized with implementation.

Outputs
- api/breaking-changes.md
- api/design-violations.md
- api/migration-guide.md
- api/compatibility-report.md
