# /xincident - Incident Response & Management

## Purpose
Automate incident response procedures, facilitate post-mortem analysis, and improve system reliability through SpecDriven AI methodology.

## Usage

### Incident Response
```bash
/xincident --respond <alert>      # Automated incident response procedures
/xincident --triage <severity>    # Triage and prioritize incidents
/xincident --escalate <level>     # Escalation procedures and notifications
/xincident --status <incident-id> # Update incident status and timeline
```

### Communication & Coordination
```bash
/xincident --communicate <team>   # Generate incident communication templates
/xincident --notify <stakeholders> # Notify relevant stakeholders
/xincident --updates <incident-id> # Create status updates for stakeholders
/xincident --bridge <participants> # Set up communication bridge
```

### Investigation & Analysis
```bash
/xincident --investigate <symptoms> # Guide investigation procedures
/xincident --timeline <incident-id> # Build incident timeline
/xincident --evidence <source>      # Collect and preserve evidence
/xincident --root-cause <incident>  # Root cause analysis framework
```

### Recovery & Mitigation
```bash
/xincident --recover <system>     # System recovery procedures
/xincident --rollback <deployment> # Automated rollback procedures
/xincident --mitigate <impact>    # Implement mitigation strategies
/xincident --validate <recovery>  # Validate recovery success
```

### Post-Mortem & Learning
```bash
/xincident --postmortem <id>      # Generate post-mortem template
/xincident --lessons <incident>   # Capture lessons learned
/xincident --actions <findings>   # Create action items from analysis
/xincident --improvement <area>   # Process improvement recommendations
```

### Monitoring & Prevention
```bash
/xincident --metrics <timeframe>  # Incident metrics and trends
/xincident --patterns <history>   # Identify recurring patterns
/xincident --prevention <type>    # Preventive measures recommendations
/xincident --readiness <team>     # Assess incident response readiness
```

## Examples

### Respond to Production Alert
```bash
/xincident --respond "api-latency-high"
# Creates: incidents/2024-01-15-api-latency/response-plan.md with automated procedures
```

### Generate Post-Mortem Report
```bash
/xincident --postmortem "inc-2024-001"
# Creates: incidents/inc-2024-001/postmortem.md with timeline, root cause, and actions
```

### Escalate Critical Incident
```bash
/xincident --escalate "level-2"
# Generates: escalation notifications and procedures for level-2 incidents
```

### Analyze Incident Patterns
```bash
/xincident --patterns "last-quarter"
# Creates: reports/incident-patterns-q4.md with trend analysis and recommendations
```

## SpecDriven AI Integration

### Incident Specifications
- Links incidents to specifications: `{#inc1a authority=system}`
- Traces failures to requirements
- Validates recovery against specifications

### Dual Coverage
- **Incident Coverage**: All critical systems have response procedures
- **Recovery Coverage**: All failure modes have documented recovery

### Traceability
- Links incidents to system specifications
- Traces post-mortem actions to requirements
- Connects patterns to architectural decisions

## Incident Response Framework

### Severity Levels
- **SEV-1**: Critical impact, immediate response required
- **SEV-2**: High impact, response within 1 hour
- **SEV-3**: Medium impact, response within 4 hours
- **SEV-4**: Low impact, response within 24 hours

### Response Phases
1. **Detection**: Alert generation and initial assessment
2. **Response**: Immediate containment and mitigation
3. **Recovery**: System restoration and validation
4. **Learning**: Post-mortem and improvement actions

### Communication Templates
- **Initial Alert**: Stakeholder notification template
- **Status Updates**: Regular progress communications
- **Resolution Notice**: Incident closure notification
- **Post-Mortem Summary**: Executive summary template

## Integration Points

- **Monitoring systems**: Alert integration and automation
- **Communication tools**: Slack, email, and PagerDuty integration
- **Documentation**: Links to system specifications and runbooks
- **JIRA/GitHub**: Issue tracking and action item management
- **CI/CD**: Automated rollback and deployment procedures

## Output Formats

- **Response procedures**: Step-by-step incident response guides
- **Communication templates**: Stakeholder notification templates
- **Post-mortem reports**: Structured analysis and learning documents
- **Metrics dashboards**: Incident trends and performance indicators
- **Action plans**: Improvement roadmaps and prevention strategies
